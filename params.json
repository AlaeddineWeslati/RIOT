{"name":"RIOT OS","tagline":"The Revolutionary IoT Operating System","body":"RIOT leverages a microkernel to provide an energy-efficient operating system for IoT solutions.\r\n\r\n## Developer Friendly\r\n* Program in C or C++ like you're used to: \r\n\r\n```\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main(void) {\r\n    puts(\"Hello world!\\n\");\r\n    while(1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Standard development tools like gcc, gdb ...\r\n* Minimized hardware dependent code\r\n* Zero learning curve embedded programming\r\n\r\n## Efficient\r\n* Robustness & code-footprint flexibility due to the microkernel architecture\r\n* Tickless scheduler enabling maximum energy-efficiency\r\n* Real-time capability due to ultra-low interrupt latency (~50 clock cycles) and priority-based scheduling\r\n* Multi-threading with ultra-low threading overhead (<25 bytes per thread)\r\n* Code once, run both on 16-bit platforms (e.g. MSP430) and on 32-bit platforms (e.g. ARM)\r\n\r\n## IoT Ready\r\n* IoT network stack\r\n * 6LoWPAN\r\n * IPv6\r\n * RPL\r\n * TCP and UDP\r\n* Flexible memory management (static and dynamic memory allocation)\r\n* High resolution and long-term timers\r\n* FAT file system\r\n* Logging system\r\n* Wiselib support (C++ algorithm library, including routing, clustering, timesync, localization, security and more algorithms)\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\nDocumentation about RIOT can be found in the corresponding Github wikis. For general issues with RIOT please refer the [RIOT wiki](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki), platform specific questions are addressed in the [boards wiki](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/boards/wiki).\r\nMore general information about how to compile, use, and implement for RIOT are available in our [doxygen documentation](http://riot-os.org/api/).\r\n\r\n# Join the RIOT!\r\nWhether you are looking for help with writing an application for RIOT, learn more about it, or just want to stay in the loop, you are invited to join the [RIOT-users mailing list](http://lists.riot-os.org/mailman/listinfo/users). For developers who want to participate and contribute to the kernel development or integrate new MCU and platform support, the [RIOT-devel mailing list(http://lists.riot-os.org/mailman/listinfo/devel) is the right place.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
