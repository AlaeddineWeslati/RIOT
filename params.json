{"name":"RIOT OS","tagline":"The Revolutionary IoT Operating System","body":"## \r\nRIOT leverages a microkernel to provide an energy-efficient operating system for IoT solutions.\r\n\r\n## Developer Friendly\r\n* Program in C or C++ like you're used to: \r\n\r\n```\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main(void) {\r\n    puts(\"Hello world!\\n\");\r\n    while(1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Standard development tools like gcc, gdb ...\r\n* Minimized hardware dependent code\r\n* Zero learning curve embedded programming\r\n\r\n## Efficient\r\n* Robustness & code-footprint flexibility due to the microkernel architecture\r\n* Tickless scheduler enabling maximum energy-efficiency\r\n* Real-time capability due to ultra-low interrupt latency (~50 clock cycles) and priority-based scheduling\r\n* Multi-threading with ultra-low threading overhead (<25 bytes per thread)\r\n* Code once, run both on 16-bit platforms (e.g. MSP430) and on 32-bit platforms (e.g. ARM)\r\n\r\n## IoT Ready\r\n* IoT network stack\r\n * 6LoWPAN\r\n * IPv6\r\n * RPL\r\n * TCP and UDP\r\n* Flexible memory management (static and dynamic memory allocation)\r\n* High resolution and long-term timers\r\n* FAT file system\r\n* Logging system\r\n* Wiselib support (C++ algorithm library, including routing, clustering, timesync, localization, security and more algorithms)\r\n\r\n# Join the RIOT!\r\nWhether you want to write an application for RIOT, learn more about it, or just stay in the loop, you are invited to join the [RIOT-users mailing list](http://lists.riot-os.org/mailman/listinfo/users). For developers who want to participate and contribute to the kernel development or integrate new MCU and platform support, the [RIOT-devel mailing list(http://lists.riot-os.org/mailman/listinfo/devel) is the right place for you.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
